What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
2). 
Both PHP and JavaScript are interpreted scripting/programming languages. This means code is executed directly without prior compilation without it having it translated into machine code, this means it is not as fast as languages like c++. 
Despite this, PHP and JS are still important because in wed dev they can be used with HTML while c++ cannot. 
PHP: used for server-side scripting, handling tasks like server request processing and interacting with databases. 
JavaScript: runs in the user's browser and can modify the HTML and CSS of a webpage.

  3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
  Model: representation. it is responsible for managing and representing and communicating the data and state of the application.
  View: Displays the data to the user in a way that can be understtod and interacted usually using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.
  Controller: processing between model and the view. Receives user inputs from the interface (ex. clicks, form submissions). Processes user requests, looks over the 
  flow of data between the Model and the View.
